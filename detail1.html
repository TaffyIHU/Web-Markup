    <h2> About HRC</h2>

     <p>Haagsche Rugby Club is one of the oldest and most prestigious rugby clubs in the Netherlands. We welcome players of all levels and ages. From junior to senior, our community thrives on passion for the sport and dedication to teamwork.</p>
    <h3> History </h3>
    <p>The association was founded in November 1932, initially under the name "Tackles", but this was soon exchanged for the current name. HRC played its matches at Laan van Poot and later at Buurtweg, among other places. In 1969, the clubhouse was built by the members themselves at the current location at Theo Mann Bouwmeesterlaan.

        HRC's first team plays in the highest class. The club won the national championship in 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1980, 1985, 1999, 2001, 2002 and 12 years later, in 2014, again. In 1969, HRC did not participate in order to be able to build their clubhouse that season. In 1979 HRC was also number 1 but the competition was ultimately not completed due to prolonged extreme weather conditions and no national champion was appointed.
        
        In the youth category, national titles have been won regularly, especially in the four oldest age categories.
        
        HRC currently (2019) has more than 700 members. This makes HRC the largest rugby club in the Netherlands. More than 550 members are younger than 20, almost 400 members play in the youngest youth categories (from 4 to 12 years).</p>
    <h3>Facilities </h3>
   <p><b>Clubhouse</b> HRC’s clubhouse is praised as one of the best in the Netherlands, featuring a bar, TVs, seating areas, a terrace, meeting rooms, and accessible facilities. The ground floor includes changing rooms, a multifunctional space, and areas for activities like pétanque. Some rooms and spaces can be rented for events. Sustainability is a key focus in the clubhouse design.</p>
    <p><b>Food and Catering (Food to Love)</b> The professional kitchen run by Food to Love offers daily meals, snacks, and specials, focusing on healthy options (with some indulgent treats). They cater team dinners and events. Contact Debby and Kenneth for more information.</p>
    <p><b>Therapy and Fitness</b> HRC has two full-sized fields, including an all-weather artificial turf field, along with smaller training fields and facilities like covered stands, dugouts, and a digital scoreboard. A physiotherapy practice and fitness studio are on-site, providing services to members and their families.</p>
